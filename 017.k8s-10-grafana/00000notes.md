# Lecture-10

>Note: remember we used ubuntu machine to create cluster so username is ubuntu only

### create cluster command

`
eksctl create cluster --name ashokit-cluster4 --region ap-south-1 --node-type t2.medium --zones ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b`

>Note: It takes time to start

### delete cluster command

`eksctl delete cluster --name ashokit-cluster4 --region ap-south-1
`


- to delete all the resources(pods,services all) we have created
        
        $ kubectl delete all --all

 - to get everything in any namespace

        $ kubectl get all  -n <namespace-name> 

- to execute manifest yml

        $ kubectl apply -f <yml-file>

- get all namespace

        $ kubectl get ns

1) HELM Charts

2) Promethues

3) Grafana

4) EFK Stack

## What is HELM ?


=> HELM is a package manager which is used to install required software's in k8s cluster

=> HELM will use charts to install required packages

=> Chart means collection of configuration files (manifest ymls)

### HELM Charts

=> Using HELM chart we can install promethues server

=> Using HELM chart we can install grafana server

### Helm Installation


$ curl -fsSl -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3

$ chmod 700 get_helm.sh

$ ./get_helm.sh

$ helm

-> check do we have metrics server on the cluster

$ kubectl top pods

$ kubectl top nodes


1) execute manifest ymls -- we are done with this process

2) use helm chart

- check helm repos 
    
        $ helm repo ls

- Add the metrics-server repo to helm
        
        $ helm repo add metrics-server https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/

- Install the chart
        
        $ helm upgrade --install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server

## Kubernetes Monitoring

=> We can monitor our k8s cluster and cluster components using below software's

1) Prometheus

2) Grafana

### Prometheus

-> Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit

-> Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data

-> It provides out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities for the k8s container orchestration platform.

### Grafana

-> Grafana is an  analysis and monitoring tool

-> It provides visualization for monitoring

-> It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.

Note: Grafana will connect with Prometheus for data source.
